    This website was a simple example of a static HTML site using a responsive
    CSS boilerplate, but it has graduated to technically become a Sinatra (ruby)
    web app. It uses Slim-lang for the template engine and YAML to store static
    data. It still uses Skeleton CSS boilerplate to remain responsive.

  title: reddit Neo4J Database
  description:
    A learning Neo4j database project of a sample of comments on the popular social 
    media platform Reddit. 
    A possible prototype database for Reddit to run on Neo4j. It can show the 
    relationships between users, their comments, and subreddits. With this information 
    we can infer demographic information about reddits users. For example we could 
    see which subreddits have the same users who post comments, and where else 
    they post.
