    This website was a simple example of a static HTML site using a responsive
    CSS boilerplate, but it has graduated to technically become a Sinatra (ruby)
    web app. It uses Slim-lang for the template engine and YAML to store static
    data. It still uses Skeleton CSS boilerplate to remain responsive.

    madmaan is a programming language that myself and a group of classmates created
    for our Language Translation and Design class. It aims to make JavaScript a
    more readable and enjoyable language to write. However, it is still very much
    under development.

    This is a RESTful API using the Rails framework to support the front end application
    of memebank. It uses JWT authentication for stateless account authentication,
    and bcrypt for password encryption. It communicates with the front-end using
    basic HTTP requests and JSON objects.

  title: Paradixm
  description:
    This project is one I participated in as part of my Interaction Design course
    at LMU. It is a project to catalog all UI elements on all platforms in hopes
    to build the ultimate UI. That dream is held by my Interaction Design course
    instructor, Prof. John David Dionisio, at Loyola Marymount University. The
    project is getting fairly populated but still has a couple of semesters until
    it comes to full fruition.
